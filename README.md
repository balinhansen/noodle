JavaScript 3D Printing Toolkit

Who am I?

I'm Balin and I want to make things with my 3D printer. I don't have $1,000 to pay McNeel Software for their industry-standard NURBS-based CAD software: Rhinoceros. I could pirate it but in the interest of self-loathing I aspire to duplicate their efforts by producing a far-inferior product: noodle.

What is my mission?

My mission is to better understand the concept of triangles in 3D-space so that I may print the volumes between them. Using my novice-to-intermediate knowledge of JavaScript and HTML, my beginner-level understand of OpenGL and hence: WebGL and quite possibily my intermediate proficiency in PHP or my non-existant experience with Node.js to produce some kind of web-based 3D modelling tool which should at the very least generate Stereolithography (.STL) files which can be converted to 3D-printable GCode with a modern slicer program like Slic3r or Cura.
